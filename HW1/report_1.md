# Review: "You and Your Research" by Richard Hemming

## Summary

This is a talk by Richard Hemming about the impact of ones relationship with research on the research. He talks about the following key boints:
- The importance of working on important problems.
- The compound interest of learning and thinking and the correlation between personal investment in research and the produced results.
- The neccessity of woriking with the system.

He explains that most of the research done is not "important" research. He emphasizes that we need to think about what research we do, how it is seen in the bigger picture, and whether it is important in the bigger picture. So in short he wants researchers to work on topics they find imporant and that actually further their field.

He explains that time investment, given that the time is invested in a smart way, produces a compound interest. That given two people of identical ability, the one who only invests one hour more per day will produce far better results then the other. He attributes this to the compound interest of learning and thinking. So if you spend just a small amount more today. That this will lead you to be slightly more productive tomorrow, further increasing the value of the one additional hour you spend. He therefore reasons that if a pearson wants to produce really great research then they need to be willing to proritize their research over other parts of their life to gain this compound advantage.

He also dives into the reality of the system and the institutions that research is confined to. He acknowledges that every good researcher has a certain drive to fight the system but he conveys that by leaning into the system and working with the system you can exploit its efficiencies without wasting time on fighting it. He tells us that this is a neccesity even if it comes at the cost of ones individuality and convictions.

He also tals about the importance of scientific dialogue with collegues not only from the same field and the incredible value contained in discussing ones work with capable people. 

## Strengths

The core strengths of the paper or rather the talk lie within his experience both within research and with his articulation. Mianly the point of working on imporant problems is a very strong point under the maxim of wanting to achieve the best possible resarch. 

## Weaknesses

The main issue with the paper is that it is not reflective on its own ideas. His perception is very much within the confines of the american system of 20th century. And while some points with certainty still aply today. It is also neccessary to appreciate the importance of context. He also leaves the term "important research" very ambiguous. He very much connects it wtih accolades and historical relevance but tons of foundational research without much glory is essential to the working of not just modern science but also our society as it is.

## My POV

I agree with his points of compound interest of time investement and the importance of working on "important" problems but I disagree with his definition of "important". I find that a researcher testing the results of someones paper and affirming or refuting it is also important. Further I assume that the system has changed quite a bit even though I can not fairly asses that due to a lack of knowledge.

## Takeaways

My main takeaways are the following. In research you have to wholehartedly commited to the work you are doing if you want it to succeed. And if you commit to something then you should beforehand and during think and reflect about whether what you are donig is important if maybe not to the world, then at least to your self. This I see as a point that does not only apply to research and science but to almost anything in life.
